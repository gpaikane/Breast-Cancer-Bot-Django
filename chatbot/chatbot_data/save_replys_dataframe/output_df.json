Some genetic changes causes cells to divide uncontrollably and provides ability to the cells to spread to other locations and destroys them. "],"3":["When cells divide uncontrollably in Breast and have ability to spread outside the Breast to other organs and destory the surround tissue is called Breast Cancer. If not treated, it can spread and destroy important organs and cause death."],"4":["A tumor or lump is any abnormal mass of tissue or swelling. Like a cyst, a tumor can form in any part of the body. A tumor can be benign or cancerous (malignant), A benign tumor has distinct, smooth, regular borders. A malignant tumor has irregular borders and grows faster than a benign tumor. \n A malignant tumor can also spread to other parts of your body. A benign tumor can become quite large, but it will not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of your body."],"5":["A cyst is a sac that may be filled with air, fluid or other material. A cyst can form in any part of the body, including bones, organs and soft tissues. Most cysts are noncancerous (benign), but sometimes cancer can cause a cyst."],"6":["Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the presence of abnormal cells inside a milk duct in the breast. DCIS is considered the earliest form of breast cancer. DCIS is noninvasive, meaning it hasn't spread out of the milk duct.  However the cells can bcome invasive in due time can spread to other organs. Hence It should be treated by consulting a Oncologist\/OncoSurgen. The positive news is that if you have only DCIS without Invasive componenet, the 10 year survival rate is 98%, however if you are diagonized  with DCIS, you will need fequent monitoring  even after treatment as your risk of cancer increases if you had DCIS."],"7":["If the cancer is very much localized to the only tissue where it originated and not spread to nearby tissue. The cancer is called in-situ.

It can be used at any stage of an illness even with curative treatment if there are troubling symptoms, such as pain or sickness. In advanced cancer, palliative treatment might help someone to live longer and more comfortably, even if they cannot be cured\nChemo, radiation and surgery can be suggested as part of palliative treatment"],"10":["Curative treatment is given to cure the cancer, which is even recommed many times are first choice of treatment even in stage 4 cancer patients."],"11":["A biopsy is a procedure to remove a piece of tissue or a sample of cells from your body so that it can be tested in a laboratory.

Most women, however, tolerate the exam quite well. If required, somtimes momography is followed by Sonomammography (Ultrasound of Breast) Sonomammography or ultrasound of the breast is a non-invasive procedure performed to check the health of breasts and the blood flow to areas inside it.\nIt is an imaging technique that is used to examine and screen for cancer or\/and other breast abnormalities.

It is also the least common form of breast cancer and the hardest to treat as it doesn't have any receptors, so treatments cannot be given targatig the receptors. They are mostly agressive, however they can be mostly cured if detected early. In Recent times new immunotherapy medicines  have shown great benifitis for advace stage tripple -ve breast cancer for some patients"],"25":["HER2-positive breast cancer is a breast cancer that tests positive for a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). This protein promotes the growth of cancer cells. In about 1 of every 5 breast cancers, the cancer cells have extra copies of the gene that makes the HER2 protein.\nTreatment is similar to other cancers, however drugs targeting HER2 receptors are also given as part of the cancer treatment "],"26":["A low grade number (grade 1) usually means the cancer is slower-growing and less likely to spread. A high grade number (grade 3) means a faster-growing cancer that's more likely to spread. An intermediate grade number (grade 2) means the cancer is growing faster than a grade 1 cancer but slower than a grade 3 cancer."],"27":["Papilloma is not a cancer and is very unlikely to develop into a cancer. But the cells of the papilloma should be examined under the microscope after it has been removed.\nSolitary papillomas (solitary intraductal papillomas) are single tumors that often grow in the large milk ducts near the nipple. They are a common cause of clear or bloody nipple discharge, especially when it comes from only one breast.

The amount of swelling may vary. Some people may have severe swelling (edema) with the affected arm being several inches larger than the other arm.\n Breast lymphedema occurs because of damage to the lymphatic system. it typically happens as a result of cancer, surgery for cancer or radiation. It's also not limited to the breast but can occur in the chest area and the armpit as well.\nPatient should protect the hand adjacent to the operated breast.\nThere are excerizes suggested after breast cancer.
